## **How to Contribute**

Because public forks are not allowed under the license, please follow this workflow:

1. **Create a private clone** of the repository on your machine.
2. Make a feature or fix branch locally (`fix/message-timing`, `improve/sound-handler`, etc.).
3. Commit clear, documented changes.
4. Submit a **pull request** to the official repo with a concise explanation of what you changed and why.
5. Follow existing code style, naming conventions, and structure.

If a change is large or might alter core behavior, open an **Issue** first to discuss it before writing code.
