# Security Policy

Deathverse is a client-and server-side Garry's Mod addon. While I do my best to keep it safe, bugs and exploits can happen.

### Reporting a Vulnerability

Found something serious (RCE, server crash, client crash, privilege escalation, etc.)?

**Please don’t open a public issue.**

Instead, report it privately:
- Open a private vulnerability report via GitHub’s built-in [“Security → Advisories” feature](https://github.com/EmreSoftware/Deathverse/security/advisories)

Include as much info as possible:
- Description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce
- Affected versions
- Potential impact

I’ll usually respond within 24–48 hours and credit you in the fix if you want.

### What happens next
- I’ll verify and fix it as fast as possible (normally same week)
- Once fixed, I’ll push an update and mention the reporter in the changelog (unless you prefer to stay anonymous)
- Only after the fix is live will the issue become public

### Rules (pretty standard)
- Don’t publicly disclose the vulnerability until it’s patched
- Don’t use it to attack other servers
- Don’t upload malicious versions to the Workshop or anywhere else

That’s literally it.

Thanks for reporting responsibly — you’re helping keep every server that uses Deathverse safer!
