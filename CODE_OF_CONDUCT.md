# Code of Conduct

### Be cool.
- Be respectful and constructive.
- No harassment, spam, trolling, or personal attacks.
- Keep discussions on-topic and helpful.

### License & Distribution Rules
This project is now **GNU GPL v3.0**.  
The only extra rule is:  
→ Don’t reupload the original (or barely changed) addon to the Steam Workshop or other sites without asking me.

Everything else that GPL allows (forking, modifying, sharing your own versions) is encouraged!

### Maintainer Rights
It’s my project, so I can:
- Close issues, reject/merge PRs, or remove comments if they’re off-topic or toxic.
- Ban people who repeatedly break the (very simple) rules above.

That’s it. No 500-word legal threats — just don’t be a dick and don’t steal the Workshop upload.

Thanks for helping make Deathverse better!
